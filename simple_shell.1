.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a basic shell program that reads and executes commands typed by the user.
It mimics the behavior of
.Xr sh 1
in both interactive and non-interactive modes. The shell progressed through several milestones:

.Bl -tag -width ".It 0.1"
.It 0.1 – Basic command execution
.br
• Executes single-word commands by full path.
.br
• Displays a prompt "$" and waits for input.
.br
• Does not support arguments or built-ins.
.sp 0.5
.It 0.2 – Command arguments
.br
• Supports commands with optional arguments.
.br
• Still does not handle PATH lookup or built-ins.
.sp 0.5
.It 0.3 – PATH handling
.br
• Looks up executables using the PATH environment variable.
.br
• Commands with arguments are supported.
.sp 0.5
.It 0.4 – exit built-in
Adds the built-in
.Pa exit
.br
• which exit/terminate the shell
.sp 0.5
.It 1.0 – env built-in
Adds the built-in
.Pa env
.br
• which prints the current environment variables.
