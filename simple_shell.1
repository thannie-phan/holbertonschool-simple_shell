.Sh NAME
.Nm simple_shell
\- a simple UNIX command line interpreter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ri
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a basic shell program that reads and executes commands typed by the user.
It mimics the behavior of
.Xr sh 1
in both interactive and non-interactive modes.
.Pp
The shell runs in an loop, continue to take in user input and process them similar to a real Shell by being built in stages below
.Bl -tag -width ".It 0.1"
.It 0.1 – Basic command execution
.br
• Executes single-word commands by full path.
.br
• Displays a prompt "$" and waits for input.
.br
• Does not support arguments or built-ins.
.sp 0.5
.It 0.2 – Command arguments
.br
• Supports commands with optional arguments.
.br
• Still does not handle PATH lookup or built-ins.
.sp 0.5
.It 0.3 – PATH handling
.br
• Looks up executables using the PATH environment variable.
.br
• Commands with arguments are supported.
.sp 0.5
.It 0.4 – exit built-in
Adds the built-in
.Pa exit
.br
• which exit/terminate the shell
.sp 0.5
.It 1.0 – env built-in
Adds the built-in
.Pa env
.br
• which prints the current environment variables.
.Sh USAGE
In interactive mode:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar ./simple_shell
Displays a prompt 
.Dq $
and waits for user input.
Executes commands with arguments.
.El
.Pp
In non-interactive mode:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar echo \&"/bin/ls\&" | ./simple_shell
Executes commands from a file or piped input.
.El
Built-in commands:
.Bl -tag -width ".It exit"
.It exit
Terminates the shell.
.It env
Prints the current environment variables.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
returns 0 on successful execution of commands.
Built-ins return 0 unless otherwise specified.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION
The shell is built around three main helper functions:
.Bl -tag -width ".It execute_command"
.It read_input
.br
• Reads user input from standard input.
.sp 0.5
.It split_string
.br
• Parses input string into command and arguments.
.sp 0.5
.It execute_command
.br
• Executes the parsed command in a child process.
.br
• Manages parent and child exit status.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
returns 0 on successful execution of commands.
Built-ins return 0 unless otherwise specified.
The shell maintains the exit status of the last executed command.
